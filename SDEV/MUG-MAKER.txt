We need a counter loop to match how many mugs the user wants to have made, and each time through the loop we ask the user to enter the string to be etched on the mug. String must be shorter than or equal to 15 characters.
Use counter controlled loop to match the mugs with the message to be etched on each one.
IF "UsrMessage" == exit
Then
leave loop
